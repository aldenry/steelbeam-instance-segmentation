# Steel Beam Instance Segmentation Using YOLOv8-Seg

This repository contains an end-to-end instance segmentation project using **YOLOv8-Seg**.  
The model is trained to segment multiple types of steel beam profiles such as:

- I-beam
- L-beam
- O-beam
- O-pipe
- T-beam
- Square-bar
- Square-pipe

## Project Overview

This project includes:

1. Dataset preprocessing  
2. Model training  
3. Evaluation using mAP and IoU  
4. Model selection  
5. Deployment using Streamlit

## How to Run the Project

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aldenry/steelbeam-instance-segmentation.git
cd steelbeam-instance-segmentation
```

### **2. Set up virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## Model Architecture (YOLOv8-Seg Summary)

YOLOv8-Seg predicts:

- bounding boxes  
- class labels  
- **pixel-level masks**

The mask is produced using:

1. **Prototype masks** — base shapes generated by the model  
2. **Mask coefficients** — weights used to combine prototypes  
3. **Fusion** → final mask that follows object boundaries 

This allows the model to segment complex steel profiles more accurately than standard object detection.

## Evaluation Metrics

YOLOv8 provides:

- **mAP@0.5 (mask)**  
- **mAP@0.5:0.95 (mask)**  
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**  

Target performance for this assignment:  
✔ mAP@0.5 > 0.75 **OR** visually accurate masks on test images.
